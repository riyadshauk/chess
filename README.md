# chess
Though I made this game for fun, I was able to include [an online demo here](http://web.engr.illinois.edu/~shauk2/), from my alma mater (working, as of this commit, at least : )
This is a chess game written in plain/vanilla-flavored ES6 JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and bundled with the Google Closure Compiler. It's modeled after [the vanilla ES6 TodoMVC example](http://todomvc.com/examples/vanilla-es6/).
